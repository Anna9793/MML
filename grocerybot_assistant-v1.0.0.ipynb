    "## Overview\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) and Reasoning + Acting (ReAct) can be used to create a conversational bot, capable of assisting a customer in their grocery shopping journey.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to find more information about these two approaches please check the relative papers: [RAG arXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.11401.pdf) & [ReAct arXiv Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.03629.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario\n",
    "Imagine you are a user of Cymbal Grocery, your favorite grocery store. You would like to cook something nice for dinner, like lasagne, but you don't know where to start, which ingredients to buy, or how to cook lasagne.\n",
    "\n",
    "You enter the website and you find that Cymbal Grocery has just released a new conversational bot, GroceryBot!\n",
    "\n",
    "GroceryBot will help you in your shopping journey by:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Suggesting you a recipe\n",
    "2. Getting the list of ingredients and cooking instructions\n",
    "3. Suggesting you products you will like to buy for that recipe\n",
    "4. Helping you find new products you'd like to buy for your dinner!\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective & Requirements\n",
    "Your objective is to develop **GroceryBot**!\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one main requirement: you will need to make sure that this bot is **grounded**. Grounding refers to the process of connecting LLMs with external knowledge sources, such as databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "In practice, this means that GroceryBot should leverage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The existing recipe catalog of Cymbal Grocery. GroceryBot should not suggest recipes that are not part of this catalog.\n",
    "2. The existing product catalog of Cymbal Grocery. GroceryBot should not suggest products that are not part of this catalog.\n",
    "3. A set of precomputed products suggested for a recipe.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, you can use an approach called Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG), which attempts to mitigate the problem of hallucination by inserting factual information (in this case, recipe and product information) into the prompt which is sent to the LLM.\n"

    "### Implementation of the GroceryBot\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This system is powered by Vertex AI Generative models and LangChain. If you are new to LangChain, it's suggested to go through [this notebook](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/generative-ai/blob/main/gemini/orchestration/intro_langchain_gemini.ipynb) to familiarize yourself with the framework.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned earlier, to ground the model you will require to connect the LLM to the internal company databases. You will do that by implementing a [ReAct like](https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/react-synergizing-reasoning-and-acting.html) Agent in LangChain, capable of taking decisions and decide when to query these databases. If you want to know more about Agents in LangChain, please visit [this page](https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/#agents)\n",
    "\n",
    "For demo purposes, this notebook will only use local databases. The following setup is adopted:\n",
    "- The Product & Recipe catalog are defined locally using [Faiss](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/vectorstores/faiss/). In a production scenario, where you need to scale beyond few examples you might want to explore [Vertex AI Matching Engine](https://cloud.google.com/vertex-ai/docs/matching-engine/overview) a managed vector database part of Vertex AI which leverages [ScaNN similarity search](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/07/announcing-scann-efficient-vector.html).\n",
    "- The details of a recipe and the suggested products to buy for that recipe are also stored locally. In a production scenario you might want to use a NoSQL database like [Cloud Datastore](https://cloud.google.com/datastore) to store this.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can see below a diagram which shows the different components of the agent and what is the expected interaction with databases."
